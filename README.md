# cohost-obsidian-bridge

This was an attempt to reformat [cohost-dl](https://github.com/cpsdqs/cohost-dl/)'s data into something that I could look at in Obsidian.
Turns out Obsidian is extremely not suited for this, so I'm abandoning this for now.

Others looking to use cohost-dl's JSON files for something might find the `Chost` model in [src/chost_json.rs](src/chost_json.rs) interesting though.
